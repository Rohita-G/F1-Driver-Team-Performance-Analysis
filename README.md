# F1 Driver Consistency & Team Performance Evolution Analysis

## Project Overview
This research project focuses on analyzing two critical aspects of Formula 1 racing:

- **Driver Consistency Tracker:** Measures the reliability and stability of individual drivers’ performance across different races and varying conditions, using metrics such as lap times, finishing positions, and race incidents.
- **Team Performance Evolution:** Examines how F1 teams evolve their performance over multiple seasons by analyzing factors like car upgrades, pit stop efficiency, race strategies, and their influence on race outcomes.

This project also explores the relationship between driver consistency and team success to provide a comprehensive understanding of performance dynamics in Formula 1.

## Motivation
While numerous studies explore either driver performance or team performance independently, this project uniquely integrates both to reveal how consistent drivers contribute to team progress and vice versa. By leveraging publicly available datasets and contextualizing the data with F1 rules—including scoring systems, pit stop effects, and reasons for race retirements—this research aims to deliver valuable insights for teams, analysts, and fans.

## Key Features
- Aggregation and preprocessing of open-source Formula 1 datasets.
- Quantitative analysis of driver consistency under diverse race conditions.
- Longitudinal study of team performance trends across seasons.
- Correlation analysis between driver consistency and team success.
- Visualizations that enhance interpretability of performance data.
